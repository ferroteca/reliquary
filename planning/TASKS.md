# TASKS

Small to-do tasks. Large tasks belong in the roadmap; the
adjudicated design-decision records live in
[DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md). Completed milestone task-breakdowns
are pruned once the milestone lands — the record survives in git
history, DECISIONS.md, and the ROADMAP milestone notes (the
milestone-4 and milestone-6 breakdowns were pruned 2026-07-23).

## Future implementation hints

- The error taxonomy under parity (ROADMAP milestone 9):
  `ReliquaryError` the root; `StaticError(2)` / `PreflightError(3)`
  / `RunFailure(4)` / `RunCancelled(5)`.
- `user.properties` and the property command family (ROADMAP
  milestone 8): use the `keyring` package for the protected host
  credential store rather than hand-rolling Windows Credential
  Manager / macOS Keychain / Secret Service backends; its
  `(service, username)` model takes the spec's scoping directly —
  the properties-file path as the service, the property name as
  the username.

## Language

- residual language problems catalogued in
  planning/design/script-examples/*.rlqs (see its README) —
  best-guess priority, fix-cost order, NOT validated against
  real authoring pain; reorder freely once we've actually
  written/debugged scripts under this surface:
  1. [08] reserve the small closed vocabularies (key names,
     drive slots) globally so they can't shadow phase/artifact
     names — mechanical, no spec redesign, also closes most of
     [01]'s asymmetry
  2. [06]'s remaining half: warn when an `@`-reference matches no
     known item (the label/item split itself is gone with the
     media block — DECISIONS.md, no JSON in scripts)
  - [03], [05], [07] — provisionally leave as documented
    tradeoffs, not bugs: boundary tax (guest-text escaping) or
    placement-equals-scope consequences, where a "fix" mostly
    just relocates the mush rather than removing it
  - [01], [02], [04], [09] are resolved (DECISIONS.md: milestone
    zero and the observation-channel decisions); their files are
    regression notes
  - note: several of these are the procedural/declarative seam
    showing through the syntax — see "Primary language goals"
    (G1–G7) and "Procedural and declarative" in ./ROADMAP.md
    before proposing fixes, and judge any fix against the goals
    it costs rather than in isolation
- the full Reason-blockquote editorial sweep of script-spec.md
  remains deliberately open (may trail realignment); the
  error-id INDEX is deferred to beta
- resume the spec-audit workflow (wf_1a266a6b-ff8): the
  AHK/Python failure-catalog studies are complete — imports
  recorded in DECISIONS.md — but their spec audits hit the
  session limit

## U6 authoring recorder

Use case in planning/USE-CASES.md; design in
planning/design/recorder.md. Work items, in rough
dependency order:

- Reliquary-owned console viewer over the vnc control plane
  (recording prerequisite: backend display-window input is
  invisible to Reliquary)
- text-mode recorder first (no new language surface: waits from
  VGA scrapes, type/press actions, generated-comment
  uncertainty flags)
- runner run-to-point / breakpoint / human-takeover machinery
  (also the failure report's "take over from here" suggested
  next command)
- round-trip: fragment emission anchored by playback position;
  opt-in surgical apply at the anchor (never regenerate, never
  text-merge)
- landmark catalog shape: decided (DECISIONS.md, the wrinkle
  round; planning/design/landmarks.md) — implementation rides
  the asset spec work
- run-events: handover event kinds (script/human control
  passing); a capture session is one run record with mixed
  drivers
- CLI record command family + API twins land together (parity)

## Watches (re-ask as these harden)

- live-run progress surface (G4 during the run — ties to
  run-events; the USE-CASES feedback split, 2026-07-21, names
  the demand)
- GUI/landmark assets forming a new authored artifact class
  (hardened 2026-07-21: .rlql is the fourth authored extension —
  the INTERFACES listing is due at the asset-spec/realignment
  pass)
- published JSON Schemas elevating `reliquary-machine.json` into a
  public contract (the blueprint and media-definition schemas
  are authored — DECISIONS.md; the state schema and its
  public-contract elevation stay with milestone 6)
- the adapter API becoming world-facing
  (planning/design/backend-adapter.md is INTERNAL by decision,
  owner 2026-07-21 — a real third-party adapter story elevates
  it into the INTERFACES inventory through the interface-change
  rule, never by drift)

## Design

- Media residency vs the download cache AND composable authored
  specs — RESOLVED together (owner, 2026-07-23, the media/composition
  design round), then REVISED same day by the blueprint revision
  round (both in DECISIONS.md; ROADMAP milestone 7 is the
  retargeted implementation): two spec types (machine / media —
  archive absorbed as the container reading), a flat typed root
  array, one schemed `location` field, no source component, no
  composition (identity-dedup instead), and the single name-keyed
  `cache/media/` with the identity ledger (content addressing
  declined in both rounds). blueprint-model.md describes the
  superseded first-round shape until its milestone-7 rewrite —
  the revision-round DECISIONS entry is normative meanwhile.
- Media lifecycle commands (`list-media`, `delete-media`, and any
  further definition-level verbs) need careful planning before
  the surface hardens: one `.rlqb` can define several media (the
  `children` form). Open questions to adjudicate and
  record in DECISIONS.md / media-spec / cli.md — what does the
  command noun name (media vs owning file)? does
  `delete-media` remove the whole file, edit specs out, or refuse
  when siblings remain? how should `list-media` present file vs
  media identity (and multi-media provenance)? `seed-media`
  already
  seeds by media name and copies the whole file — keep or
  revisit that invariant together with delete/list. The current
  provisional twins (media-name delete of the owning file; list
  of media names) are placeholders pending this round, not
  settled design.

## Wishlist

- `download-media` command (owner request, 2026-07-22; shape to
  re-derive under the revised model — milestone 7's `add-media`
  covers its cache-warming half): `rlq download-media
  https://freedos.org/downloads/FreeDOS14.zip` downloads the file
  into `cache/media/`,
  computes its sha256, and scaffolds a standalone `.rlqb` into
  the home library carrying the url + sha256 — a media spec,
  with `children` left for the user to add when the payload is a
  container. A home-mode
  convenience: it warms the cache and writes the committed-source
  stub so the user need not hand-author it and then `fetch`. Open
  shape: members can't be
  inferred, so the stub stops at the container and the user adds
  the extraction tree (with `extract-media`); stem-default naming
  from
  the URL filename; a `--local <file>` variant for
  non-downloadable
  payloads (overlaps `add-media` — reconcile when picked up);
  CLI+API parity (a twin returning the written blueprint
  path).
- `extract-media` command (owner request, 2026-07-23; re-derive
  under the revised model) — the
  incremental companion to `download-media`: `rlq extract-media
  --parent FreeDOS14 FreeDOS14-LiveCD.zip` extracts the child
  from
  the named media,
  computes its sha256, and records it by
  **appending a child** (path + sha256) to the
  existing media spec's `children` (the leaning option)
  rather than writing a separate file — or as a flat
  `${media:…}`-located spec; reconcile when picked up. A child
  that is itself a
  container becomes another node to drill into (`extract` it
  again); a
  payload child is extracted to `cache/media/`. So
  a nested source is hand-authored by walking down it one
  `extract-media` at a time, the `children` tree growing
  in place. Open: new-file vs append-to-existing (lean append);
  node shape (child is itself a container → node with its own
  `children`, else leaf).
- new command diff-blueprint <name>: diff the user blueprint
  against the codex blueprint of the same name
- CLI, from cli help: --version should be `version` with an
  undocumented --version/-v alias; -h should be `help` with
  undocumented -h/--help aliases
- --qemu → --qemu-home
- CLI help: run-script's text says little more than "runs a
  script on a machine"
- an 'inventory' report: every item in the home and cache dirs
  itemized in one way or another (backend implementation files
  ignored — just the presence of a machine is noticed):
  - orphaned listed first (because either you *really* want to
    keep it, or you really *should* delete it): media
    (definitions, not cached payloads), scripts
  - blueprints: materialized (online machines, offline
    machines), unmaterialized
  - media: referenced
  - scripts: orphaned (listed first??), referenced
- README, blueprints and machines: give several clear examples
  to illustrate the concepts — e.g. a 1 MB MS-DOS blueprint;
  QEMU machine #0; QEMU machine #1; QEMU machine #3 with a
  specific floppy image mounted; QEMU machine #4 with 16 MB of
  memory and a specific cdrom mounted
- CLI clean — RESOLVED by the blueprint revision round
  (DECISIONS.md, 2026-07-23): `clean-media` (blunt + targeted
  eviction) and `prune-media` (attachment-closure prune of
  unneeded entries) land at milestone 7; `clean-archives`
  retires with the single cache dir. Machine-cache cleaning
  remains the open decision in ROADMAP "Decisions still
  needed".
