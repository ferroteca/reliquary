# TASKS

Small to-do tasks.  Large tasks belong in the roadmap.

- ABSOLUTE PRIORITY #1: realign the implementation with the redesigned script language
  - the July 2026 redesign is decided; docs/script-spec.md is the source of truth
    (full typed EBNF included) and design-install.rlqs (repo root) is the
    reference script
  - the redesign resolves the old "clunky/awkward" critiques: one node shape
    (name, args, name=value props, optional block), spelling-reveals-role tokens
    ("text", /regex/, @media-ref, $input-ref, bare internal names), no commas or
    colons anywhere, phase/goto/finish (was state/->/done), expect folded into
    the branching wait { on ... }, colon-free noun-first headers with entry and
    a run-level deadline
  - timing model: timeout/stable are lexically scoped defaults (innermost wins),
    deadline is a per-activation budget (fresh per phase entry; header deadline
    backstops the run); the placement matrix is enforced as parse errors
  - work items:
    - retarget script.py to the node grammar (parser should shrink: colon,
      comma, expect, ->, and regex-keyword handling all disappear)
    - retarget script_runner.py; failure diagnostics name the expired clock
      and its source scope; check-script reports the resolved timing plan
    - convert builtin scripts and examples/ scripts to the new surface
    - update every doc that quotes script syntax (README, examples/README)
    - no backward compatibility: delete the old surface entirely
  - residual language problems catalogued in script-examples/*.rlqs (see its
    README) — best-guess priority, fix-cost order, NOT validated against real
    authoring pain, reorder freely once we've actually written/debugged
    scripts under this surface:
    1. [08] reserve the small closed vocabularies (key names, drive slots)
       globally so they can't shadow phase/artifact names — mechanical, no
       spec redesign, also closes most of [01]'s asymmetry
    2. [06] default a single-item media block's label to its item name;
       warn when an @-reference doesn't match any known item
    3. [01] rename the `enter` verb (or accept it) — cheap once decided,
       mostly a taste call, wants a gut check rather than more analysis
    4. [04] the `on` one-shot-vs-reactive lifecycle split — the one true
       polysemy bug here; unsure a fix is worth it without seeing how often
       scripts actually hit both forms side by side
    5. [02], [03], [05], [07], [09] — provisionally leave as documented
       tradeoffs, not bugs: boundary tax (guest-text/host-path, string/regex
       escaping) or placement-equals-scope consequences, where a "fix"
       mostly just relocates the mush rather than removing it
- install script output currently is UGLY, it needs to be BEAUTFIUL, TIMELY, and INFORMATIVE
- "rlq script install --blueprint freedos-1.4-plain" should be our north star
  - "rlq --blueprint freedos-1.4-plain script install" is identical 
- allow specifying cache location outside of home dir
- tension between 'media/download' that we need to resolve
  - see 'inventory'
  - we haven't quite nailed the model concepts and their relationships yet:
    - a downloadable (cached) object:
      - can be an item needed at runtime
      - can be an archive containing multiple:
        - item needed at runtime
    - a locally (non-cache) specified object:
      - can be an archive?
      - can be in item needed at runtime
    - when 'cleaning'
      - ?? 
- 'list blueprints' should have a 'NAME' column and announce that these are scripts in <home_script_dir> (top line 
  instead of home dir announcement)
- new command 'diff blueprint <name>' should diff the user blueprint to the built-in blueprint of the same name
- new 'delete <blueprint>' command
  - warn if there are active child machines (wait for confirm or block)
    - if confirmed, stop machines
      - block if can't stop
  - delete machines 
  - delete blueprint
  - check if there are linked scripts
  - if they would be orphaned
    - if they exist (by name) in the built-in library
      - if there is a script difference between user & built-in
        - do not block, do not delete
        - clearly announce not delete script because it is different from the built-in version
      - else
        - delete script
- change "builtin library" concept to "template library" ??
- CLI do we need these (from cli help)\
  - --platform
  - --version (should be version with undocumented --version -v alias)
  - -h (should be help with -h --help undocumented alias)
- 'reliquary -h' should reflect command as "reliquary", 'rlq -h' otherwise
- --qemu --> --qemu-home
- locks lifecyle I see cache\machines\.locks\<blueprint>.lock"
  - when deleting machines/blueprints, should these be cleaned up?
  - i.e. what is the lifecycle, is this the right location?
- cli help
  - script "runs a scipt on a machine" not much more than that
- we need an 'inventory' report:
  - every item in the home and cache dirs should be itemized in one way or another!
  -  backend implementation files ignored, just the presence of a machine is noticed
  - orphaned (listed first because, either you *really* want to keep it, or, you really *should* delete it)
    - media (specs not cached media)
    - scripts
  - blueprints
    - materialized
      - online machines
      - offline machines
    - unmaterialized
  - media
    - referenced
  - scripts
    - orphaned (should be listed first??)
    - referenced
- readme
  - blueprints and machines
    - give several clear examples to illustrate the concepts
      - e.g. 1mb ms-dos blueprint
        - QEMU machine #0
        - QEMU machine #1
        - QEMU machine #3 with a specific floppy image mounted
        - QEMU machine #4 with 16mb of memory and a specific cdrom mounted
- CLI 'clean', needs some serious thought
  - delete completely unreferenced media?
  - all downloads? unreferenced?
