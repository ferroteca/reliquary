# Changelog

All notable changes to relict are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `create_hdd_image(filename, capacity)` creates a sparse qcow2 v3
  (`compat=1.1`, no preallocation) hard-disk image at the given path.
  Capacity accepts a qemu-img size string (`"2G"`, `"512M"`) or a
  positive integer MiB value. `find_qemu_img()` resolves `qemu-img`
  with the same search order as `find_qemu()`.
- `documents_dir()` publicly resolves the user's platform Documents
  folder (or `None` when it cannot be determined), so embedding
  projects can anchor their own state directories the same way relict
  anchors its home.

### Removed

- The `boot-to-dos` CLI command. Wait for a prompt with `relict wait`.
  Programmatic boot readiness remains `AgentlessGuestExec.wait_ready()`.

### Changed

- Added an internal, runtime-checkable `GuestExec` protocol and isolated the
  QMP keyboard/VGA implementation as `AgentlessGuestExec`, with the DOS
  workflow and CLI consuming that adapter directly. The former
  `boot_to_dos()` and `run_command()` Python facades were removed; use
  `AgentlessGuestExec.wait_ready()` and `.execute()`.
- Exposed the identity-verified QMP session through `Machine.qmp()` for raw
  `cmd()` and `hmp()` access; interaction adapters now depend on `Machine`
  instead of opening QMP connections themselves.
- One validated `MachineConfig` now threads through the workflow and
  lifecycle layers. `start()`, `run_task()`, and `run_guest_program()` take a
  `MachineConfig`, versioned mapping, or JSON path as their sole machine
  settings input; `Runner.run()` passes its configuration through unchanged,
  and the QEMU launcher consumes that configuration instead of loose hardware
  arguments. The default QEMU argument vector is unchanged.
- The Python API now automatically discovers and loads `<home>/machine.json`
  when no explicit configuration is provided, matching CLI behavior. Explicit
  API values (passed as `MachineConfig`, mapping, or path) override the file
  values; `Runner` likewise loads the file when `config=None`.

### Added

- `--machine PATH` CLI argument for explicit machine configuration file selection; when omitted, the CLI automatically
  loads `<effective-home>/machine.json` if present, otherwise uses the default `MachineConfig()`. Explicit CLI
  overrides (`--platform`, `--qemu`, and raw QEMU arguments) apply on top of the loaded configuration; an omitted
  `--platform` leaves the file's platform unchanged, while `--platform dos` still overrides a non-DOS file value.
- `MachineConfig.from_file()` and `MachineConfig.from_mapping()` load a versioned JSON/mapping machine document
  (`version` must be `1`), normalize it immutably, resolve relative drive sources from the file directory or an
  explicit `base_dir`, and apply field overrides with deterministic merge rules for drives and options.
- Package-based `relict/` source layout split into home containment, declared media, ownership-safe lifecycle, generic
  machine interaction, DOS platform behavior, workflow orchestration, and CLI modules while preserving the existing
  root import and command-line interfaces.
- The complete DOS runner from the original implementation: DOS remains the default platform, while
  `MachineConfig(platform=...)` and `--platform` make the platform choice explicit. The reusable QEMU machine layer is
  shared; unimplemented non-DOS platform workflows fail explicitly instead of borrowing DOS assumptions.
- DOS 8.3 executable-name validation now belongs to the DOS platform module rather than generic workflow
  orchestration, so future guest-program workflows are not constrained by DOS naming rules.
- `Runner`/`MachineConfig`: the generic embedding surface for callers driving relict as a runner.
  `Runner(home=None, config=None)` is a configured DOS test machine bound to one absolute home (the established
  process default when omitted), and
  `run(exe_path, args)` automatically ensures bootable media before performing the full `run_guest_program()`
  lifecycle. Provisioning is private; callers create distinct runners with distinct homes for concurrent runs, and
  per-home `vm.json` keeps VM ownership sound.
- Removed the `boot_floppy_image` and `boot_hdd_image` configuration shortcuts. Custom boot media uses the ordinary
  declared-drive inventory.
- `MachineConfig.drives` adds immutable configured drive specs using canonical logical slots plus `floppy`/`hdd`
  slot-zero aliases. A spec accepts a source path or `{source, options}` mapping; files mount as images, floppy and
  hard-disk directories mount as vvfat, and CD-ROM directories fail validation. Configured and home-directory media
  resolve into one inventory with slot conflicts rejected before launch.
- `MachineConfig.machine` maps directly to one QEMU `-machine` argument. A string selects the machine type; a mapping
  combines required `type` with immutable scalar properties and renders Boolean values as `on`/`off`. A raw
  `-machine` or `-M` in `qemu_args` conflicts with the structured field.
- `MachineConfig.memory` configures guest memory as a positive integer number of MiB, defaulting to 16 for DOS, 64
  for Win9x, and 256 for WinNT. It maps to one QEMU `-m` argument; an explicit value conflicts with raw `-m` in
  `qemu_args`, while a raw `-m` alone suppresses the platform default.
- The `drives/` directory under the home declares the whole machine by filename, with image content never
  interrogated. Image files `floppy[_<n>].<ext>` (slots 0–1, A: and B:), `hdd[_<n>].<ext>` (slots 0–3, the IDE bus),
  and `cdrom[_<n>].<ext>` (the IDE slots after the hard disks) mount as that medium; bare directories `floppy[_<n>]`
  and `hdd[_<n>]` mount as virtual FAT drives. An unindexed name means slot 0 (so `hdd.img` and `hdd_0.img` clash,
  as do all duplicate slots — fail closed). The idiomatic extension declares the image format: `*.img` and `*.iso`
  are taken as raw and pinned (avoiding QEMU's format-probing warning); any other extension (`hdd.qcow2`,
  `hdd.vmdk`, ...) is handed to QEMU to identify. Memory defaults to 16 MB and the boot order to a best guess from
  the declared media (slot-0 floppy image, else slot-0 hard-disk image, else cdrom); `-m` or `-boot` in the extra
  QEMU arguments overrides the corresponding default.
- The staged guest hard drive's letter is explicit configuration: `staged_drive` on `MachineConfig` and
  `run_guest_program()` (valid C–Z, normalized uppercase; default: match the declared machine, one letter per
  hard-disk slot before the staged drive, so C: on a floppy-boot machine and D: behind a slot-0 hard-disk image;
  letters below the default are rejected) declares where the staged vvfat hard disk appears in the guest — the drive
  relict switches to for guest program runs. Staging targets the highest staged directory declared among the
  hard-disk slots, or `drives/hdd` created on demand.
- Explicit `home=` keyword on `download()`, `start()`, `stop()`, `run_guest_program()`, and the `drives_dir` path
  helper, overriding the process-global home per call. The
  existing `set_home()`/`--home` surface is unchanged.
- Installable `relict_tests` unit-test package, runnable with
  `python -m unittest -v relict_tests` so users and downstream packagers can verify an unpacked source distribution or
  installed wheel.
- Contributor guidelines covering development, verification, pull requests, and BSD-3-Clause contribution licensing.
- agentless DOS-under-QEMU automation harness — boot DOS headless, send keystrokes over QMP, scrape the 80x25 text
  screen from VGA memory, run commands with prompt-based completion detection, take screenshots, stage guest media
  via vvfat, and run guest programs end to end
  (`run_guest_program`, returning the program's redirected output).
- Visible manual VM sessions with `relict start --display`: the command returns once QEMU is ready, leaves the DOS VM
  running for direct interaction, and `relict stop` closes it through the same ownership-verified lifecycle.
- Bring-your-own boot image: relict boots whatever the user declares under `drives/`.
- Test-framework result parsing is out of scope: relict hands back raw guest output, and interpreting it belongs to
  the caller.
- QEMU binary discovery: `RELICT_QEMU_HOME` / `QEMU_HOME`, then PATH, then well-known install locations; `--qemu`
  overrides.
- Home directory (boot images, staged guest drives, screenshots) defaulting to `relict/` under the user's Documents
  folder (the Windows known Documents folder, `~/Documents` on macOS, `xdg-user-dir DOCUMENTS` on Linux/BSD), falling
  back to `~/relict` when no Documents folder can be determined; override with `RELICT_HOME`, `--home`, or
  `set_home()`.
- Native PNG screendump on QEMU >= 7.1 with a zero-dependency PPM-to-PNG fallback for older QEMU.
- Automatic QMP port selection with the selected port returned by
  `start()`, active-VM metadata under the relict home for separate CLI invocations, and unique-name verification
  before any VM is controlled.
- DOS startup commands such as switching to C: use the ordinary
  `AgentlessGuestExec.execute()` interface rather than special boot options.
- Screenshot names are constrained to filenames so captured images cannot be written outside the relict home.
- The installable test suite uses Python 3.9-compatible syntax, matching the package's declared minimum version.
